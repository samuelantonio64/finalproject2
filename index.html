	<h1 style="color:orange;font-family:courier new;">Whats the Problem with climate change?</h1>
	<img style="-webkit-user-select: none;background-position: 0px 0px, 10px 10px;background-size: 20px 20px;background-image:linear-gradient(45deg, #eee 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 75%, #eee 75%, #eee 100%),linear-gradient(45deg, #eee 25%, white 25%, white 75%, #eee 75%, #eee 100%);" src="images/climatechange.png">
<p style="font-size:300%;color:orange;font-family:courier new;">Burning fossil fuels, such as coal and gas, account for most of the world’s global warming pollution. Some say we have harmed the planet sufficiently that there is no going back.</p> 
<p style="font-size:300%;color:orange;font-family:courier new;">We are already seeing some of the effects—droughts, floods and storms. Climate change is here and now, and they are only going to get worse. Poor communities, especially in developing nations, suffer the most.</p>
   <h1 style="color:orange;font-size: 300%;font-family:courier new;">Solutions?</h1>
   <h2 style="color:orange;font-size: 300%;font-family:courier new;">Move Closer to Work.</h2>>
   <img style="-webkit-user-select: none;background-position: 0px 0px, 10px 10px;background-size: 20px 20px;background-image:linear-gradient(45deg, #eee 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 75%, #eee 75%, #eee 100%),linear-gradient(45deg, #eee 25%, white 25%, white 75%, #eee 75%, #eee 100%);" src="images/transportation.jpg">
   <p style="color:orange;font-size:300%;font-family:courier new;">
   Transportation is the second leading source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. (burning a single gallon of gasoline produces 20 pounds of CO2). But it doesn't have to be that way.One way to dramatically curtail transportation fuel needs is to move closer to work, use mass transit, or switch to walking, cycling or some other mode of transport that does not require anything other than human energy. There is also the option of working from home and telecommuting several days a week.</p>

   <h2 style="color:orange;font-size: 300%;">Consume Less</h2>
   <img style="-webkit-user-select: none;background-position: 0px 0px, 10px 10px;background-size: 20px 20px;background-image:linear-gradient(45deg, #eee 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 75%, #eee 75%, #eee 100%),linear-gradient(45deg, #eee 25%, white 25%, white 75%, #eee 75%, #eee 100%);" src="file:///Volumes/PHILIPS%20UFD/finalproject/images/consume.jpg">
    <p style="color:orange;font-size:300%;font-family:courier new;">
    The easiest way to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions is simply to buy less stuff. Whether by forgoing an automobile or employing a reusable grocery sack, cutting back on consumption results in fewer fossil fuels being burned to extract, produce and ship products around the globe.Think green when making purchases. For instance, if you are in the market for a new car, buy one that will last the longest and have the least impact on the environment. Thus, a used vehicle with a hybrid engine offers superior fuel efficiency over the long haul while saving the environmental impact of new car manufacture.</p>
    <h2 style="color:orange;font-size: 300%;font-family:courier new;">Stop Cutting Down Trees</h2>
    <img style="-webkit-user-select: none;background-position: 0px 0px, 10px 10px;background-size: 20px 20px;background-image:linear-gradient(45deg, #eee 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 75%, #eee 75%, #eee 100%),linear-gradient(45deg, #eee 25%, white 25%, white 75%, #eee 75%, #eee 100%);" src="file:///Volumes/PHILIPS%20UFD/finalproject/images/trees.jpg">
     <p style="color:orange;font-size:300%;font-family:courier new;">
     Every year, 33 million acres of forests are cut down. Timber harvesting in the tropics alone contributes 1.5 billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere. That represents 20 percent of human-made greenhouse gas emissions and a source that could be avoided relatively easily.</p>

     <h2 style="color:orange;font-size: 300%;font-family:courier new;">Saving energy</h2>
     <img style="-webkit-user-select: none;background-position: 0px 0px, 10px 10px;background-size: 20px 20px;background-image:linear-gradient(45deg, #eee 25%, transparent 25%, transparent 75%, #eee 75%, #eee 100%),linear-gradient(45deg, #eee 25%, white 25%, white 75%, #eee 75%, #eee 100%);" src="file:///Volumes/PHILIPS%20UFD/finalproject/images/energey.jpg">
     	<p style="color:orange;font-size:300%;font-family:courier new;">
        Beliee it or not, U.S. citizens spend more money on electricity to power devices when off than when on. Televisions, stereo equipment, computers, battery chargers and a host of other gadgets and appliances consume more energy when seemingly switched off, so unplug them instead.Purchasing energy-efficient gadgets can also save both energy and money—and thus prevent more greenhouse gas emissions. To take but one example, efficient battery chargers could save more than one billion kilowatt-hours of electricity—$100 million at today's electricity prices—and thus prevent the release of more than one million metric tons of greenhouse gases.</p> </p>
